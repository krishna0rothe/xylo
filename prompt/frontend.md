Create a visually striking and modern design for the Xylo Storefront landing page. The design should cater to both light and dark modes, emphasizing a gaming-centric aesthetic. Use a color scheme that incorporates deep purples, vibrant pinks, and contrasting accents to create an immersive and exciting atmosphere.

Key styling elements to consider:

1. Typography: Use bold, futuristic fonts for headings and clean, readable fonts for body text. Implement a typographic hierarchy that guides users through the content.
2. Color Palette: Develop a color scheme that works well in both light and dark modes. Use Tailwind CSS to define custom colors, focusing on:

1. Primary: A deep purple (`#7C3AED`)
2. Secondary: A vibrant pink (`#EC4899`)
3. Accent: A contrasting color like cyan (`#06B6D4`) for call-to-action elements
4. Background: Dark (`#1F2937`) for dark mode, light (`#F9FAFB`) for light mode
5. Text: Ensure high contrast and readability in both modes



3. Layout: Create a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes. Implement a seamless transition between mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
4. Components: Utilize shadcn/ui components and customize them to fit the gaming theme. Pay special attention to:

1. Cards for featured games and latest releases
2. Buttons with hover effects and clear visual hierarchy
3. Input fields with custom styling for the search and newsletter sections



5. Imagery: Incorporate game-related imagery and icons. Use the Image component from Next.js for optimized loading. Consider adding subtle animations or transitions to images on hover.
6. Sections: Style each section distinctly while maintaining overall cohesion:

1. Hero: Full-width background image with overlay and centered content
2. Featured Games: Grid layout with hover effects on game cards
3. Categories: Stylized buttons or cards for each game genre
4. Latest Releases: Horizontal scrolling carousel on mobile, grid on larger screens
5. Community Spotlight: Testimonial cards with custom styling
6. Call to Action: High-contrast background with prominent buttons



7. Navigation: Design a sleek, sticky header with a logo, navigation links, and a theme toggle button. Implement a mobile-friendly menu for smaller screens.
8. Footer: Create a comprehensive footer with a dark background, organized link sections, and a newsletter signup form.
9. Accessibility: Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate focus states and color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.
10. Performance: Optimize CSS by leveraging Tailwind's purge feature to remove unused styles in production.


Implement this styling using Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom CSS where necessary. Ensure the design is consistent across different browsers and devices, providing a seamless and engaging user experience for the Xylo gaming
